# Session Assets

Asset packs are distributed separately from `session-core`.

To load an asset pack, unzip the bundle and put all asset media files into `assets/pack/*`. The assets there will be picked up by the Session player.

### Asset Packs

Asset Packs are `.zip` bundles of images and video media for the game.

The internal file structure must be the following:

```
videos/
  greet.webm
  stroke.webm
  tits.webm
  sexv.webm
  sext.webm
  sexo.webm
  cum-facial.webm
images/
  preview.png
```
